# This repo demonstates the control of a turtlebot in simulation using basic ROS concepts.

In this repo, I have implemented basic ROS2 concepts, like topics, publishers and subscribers, alongwith a closed loop controller, "turtle_controller.py" to control the turtlebot in simulation using a very basic control logic, i.e. avoid collision with walls based on its (turtlebot) distance from them.
